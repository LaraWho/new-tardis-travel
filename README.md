Time to Travel - https://www.time-to-travel.fun/

My personal project at DevMountain.

My idea was to create a wanderlust journal for travellers. 
I made all graphics and animations from scratch, using a prototyping tool called Figma, and CSS.

It’s Doctor Who themed, not just because I’m a massive fan, but because the TARDIS (which is the Doctor’s transport) travels in time and space…and as a traveller, the ability to travel anywhere in a moment is really exciting! 

For travel inspiration, once a user has logged into my site they can travel in the TARDIS to a surprise location, as fans will know the TARDIS always takes you where you need to go - not where you want to go. That’s part of the fun.

I used the Unsplash API to generate a random travel photo. The data I received from this request included location information, so a user can add this along with the photo to a journal entry for future reference. 

A user can also add a journal entry unrelated to this feature, for recording the travel adventures they may be experiencing in the moment. Any of the saved entries can be edited and deleted by the user.

I added an info page to help clarify the intention and navigation of the site. 

I used Bcrypt, and Nodemailer to send an email to the user when they register. The email of registration success includes a link to my hosted site.

Here's the prototype I created on Figma:
